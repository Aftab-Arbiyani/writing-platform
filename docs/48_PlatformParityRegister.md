# 48 — Platform Parity Register (web ↔ mobile)

**Status:** 🔒 Binding · **Owner:** every client epic · **Last swept:** 2026-07-28 (after W3a on web +
the W-1 related-pieces port and the M-1 invite fix on mobile)

> **The rule.** **Web and mobile ship the same features.** Neither platform is allowed to drift
> ahead of the other with product surface that the other has no plan for. A divergence is only
> acceptable when it is (a) recorded in this register, and (b) either assigned to an epic that
> closes it or classified as platform-inherent in §4.
>
> **Nothing new gets built that is not in [45](./45_WebClientRoadmap.md).** An epic delivers the
> surface its roadmap row names — porting from the platform that already has it — and nothing more.
> "It would be nice to also add…" is how the two clients drift apart, and closing that drift later
> costs more than the feature was worth.

This register is the single source of truth for **where the two clients differ today**. It is swept
at the end of every client epic (step 7 of the per-epic flow, [45 §2](./45_WebClientRoadmap.md)).

## 1. Why this document exists

Mobile shipped **M1–M10 + AF1–AF6 + P7.1–P7.4** and is the most complete surface in the product.
Every AF epic shipped **backend + mobile** and deferred **frontend + admin**, which is the gap the
W-track closes. So the default direction is **mobile → web**: mobile is the reference
implementation, and a W epic ports from it rather than inventing.

That default has one failure mode, and it has already happened once (§3): building a surface on web
that mobile does not have. It is not "extra value" — it is an unplanned divergence that some future
epic now has to reconcile.

## 2. Current divergences (mobile → web: web is behind)

## 3. Divergences where mobile is behind

`M-1` (mobile's broken story invite) was **closed on 2026-07-28** — both clients now resolve a handle
to an id and send `{inviteeId, role}`. Mobile's fix and the three further defects found with it are in
`qalam-mobile/docs/50` ("Invite by handle"); the analysis in §3.1 stays because it is the clearest
example of why §6 step 2 exists.

**Two new rows opened the same day**, found by the pre-W3b reference audit that M-1 taught us to run
(§3.2). Both are mobile defects of the same kind — a client written against an imagined contract:

| #   | Area                                     | Contract reality                                                                                                        | Mobile does                                                                                                                                                                                     | Resolution                                                       |
| --- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| M-2 | **Create a suggestion (AF6)**            | `CreateSuggestionDto` = `{anchor:{from,to}, originalText, suggestedText}`; `anchor` **required**                        | Sends `{originalText, suggestedText, blockId?, rationale?}` — **no anchor**, plus two unknown properties                                                                                        | ⏳ **Open, unowned.** W3b must build from the contract, not port |
| M-3 | **Comment threads + suggestion display** | `CommentDto` has ids only, no `replies`; threads come from `GET /comments/:id/thread`. `SuggestionDto` carries `anchor` | Entities parse `authorName`, `authorAvatarKey`, `replies`, `blockId`, `rationale`, `resolvedBy` — **none of which the wire sends**; the thread endpoint is never called; `anchor` is not parsed | ⏳ **Open, unowned.** Same fix shape as M-1's entity cleanup     |

### 3.1 M-1 — mobile's story invite could not work against the frozen contract (fixed)

Found on 2026-07-28 while verifying the W3 reference (this register's own §6 step 2). It is a
**defect**, not a divergence of scope — worth recording here because it means **mobile is not a valid
reference for this one surface**, which is exactly the assumption a W-track epic starts from.

- Mobile sends `{role, email?, userId?}` — `lib/features/collaboration/data/datasources/collaboration_remote_data_source.dart`
  (`invite`), fed by an email text field in `collaborators_screen.dart`.
- The contract requires `{inviteeId: UUID, role}` (`CreateInvitationDto`), and the app runs
  `ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: true })` — so `email` / `userId` are
  rejected as unknown properties **and** the required `inviteeId` is missing. Every mobile invite
  400s. There is no email-invite path anywhere in the collaboration module.
- `qalam-mobile/docs/50` describes manual testing of "invite by role → the invitee sees it in
  Invitations Inbox → accept". That path cannot have succeeded; treat that line as unverified.

**Fixed 2026-07-28 on both clients.** Web (W3a) built the contract-correct flow first; mobile was then
brought to the same shape — `{inviteeId, role}` with a handle picker resolving through
`GET /users/:username`. Verified against a live backend on both sides and pinned by a regression test
on each (`invite-dialog.spec.tsx`, `invite_contract_test.dart`).

**Three further defects surfaced in the same mobile flow**, all from the same email-shaped assumption:
the sheet's only button was _Cancel_ yet the code invited after it popped; `accept` was decoded as an
invitation when the endpoint returns `MemberDto`; and `StoryInvitation` carried four fields the wire
never sends (`inviteeEmail`, `inviteeUserId`, `invitedByName`, `storyTitle`), so the screens showing
them displayed nothing. All fixed — details in `qalam-mobile/docs/50`.

**The lesson, sharpened:** §6 step 2 must compare the reference's **request and response shapes to the
DTOs**, not just confirm a screen exists. A screen-list check would have passed every one of these.

### 3.2 M-2 / M-3 — the pre-W3b reference audit (2026-07-28)

Run **before** starting W3b, precisely because M-1 showed a screen list proves nothing. Mobile's
comment and suggestion surfaces were compared field-by-field against `CreateCommentDto`,
`CreateReplyDto`, `CreateSuggestionDto`, `CommentDto`, `SuggestionDto` and `CommentThreadDto`.

**Broken (would 400 on every call) — `addSuggestion`:**

- Omits the **required** `anchor` (`{from, to}`), so nested validation fails.
- Sends `blockId` and `rationale`, neither of which exists in `CreateSuggestionDto` → rejected as
  unknown properties under `forbidNonWhitelisted`.
- It is currently **unreachable**: mobile's suggestions screen has no create affordance, only
  accept / reject / withdraw. So mobile can act on suggestions it has no way to produce.

**Phantom response fields (parse to null forever, and the UI displays some of them):**

| Entity                 | Reads keys the wire never sends                                    | Missing from the entity                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `EditSuggestion`       | `blockId`, `rationale`/`note`, `authorName`/`author`, `resolvedBy` | **`anchor`** — so the text range is unknown |
| `CollaborationComment` | `authorName`/`author`, `authorAvatarKey`, `replies`                | `resolvedById`, `updatedAt`                 |

`SuggestionDto` names the field `resolvedById`, not `resolvedBy`; the suggestions screen renders
`suggestion.rationale`, which can never arrive.

**Threads are unreachable.** `CommentDto` carries no `replies` array — a thread is fetched from
`GET /comments/:id/thread` (`CommentThreadDto {comment, replies}`), and **mobile never calls it** (no
path, no method). The nested-reply parsing in `CollaborationComment` is dead code.

**Latent, not yet firing:** `addComment` sends `parentId`, which `CreateCommentDto` does not allow.
The only caller passes none, so the key is omitted — but any future reply-via-addComment wiring 400s.
Replies have their own endpoint (`POST /comments/:id/replies`, `CreateReplyDto {body, mentions?}`),
which mobile does call correctly.

**Also functional, not a validation error:** story comments and suggestions are **cursor-paginated**
(`CommentListQueryDto`, envelope `meta.pagination`), but mobile reads them with a plain list call and
no cursor — so only the first page is ever shown, silently.

**Consequence for W3b:** the comments half is a partial reference (correct create + reply, broken
entities, no threads); the suggestions half is **not a reference at all**. W3b builds both from the
DTOs, exactly as W3a did for invite.

---

## 3b. Divergence created by web (web → mobile)

**None open.** One item ever appeared here — `W-1`, the reader's "More like this" — and it was a
mistake of scope, recorded rather than quietly kept. It was **closed on 2026-07-28** by porting the
section to mobile (`lib/features/reading/presentation/widgets/related_pieces.dart`, report
`qalam-mobile/docs/55_MobileRelatedPiecesPort.md`). The record of how it happened stays below,
because the lesson is the reason this register exists.

**How it happened, so it does not happen again.** [45 §4.1](./45_WebClientRoadmap.md) lists
"Author card + related pieces — mobile's `reader_author_card`". Mobile's author card contains the
author card and **no related pieces** — the phrase was the roadmap's aspiration, not a description
of something to port. It was built on web without checking that the named reference actually
contained it.

**The lesson for every future epic:** when a roadmap bullet says "port mobile's X", **open X and
confirm it contains what the bullet claims** before building. If it does not, the bullet is a new
feature request, not a port — and it goes back to the roadmap for a decision instead of being built.

### 3.1 Resolution — ported to mobile (✅ landed 2026-07-28)

**Decided 2026-07-27, delivered 2026-07-28.** Parity was restored by adding the section to mobile
rather than removing it from web, ahead of W3 and every other W-track row.

Scope as delivered — a port, not a redesign:

- A "More like this" section under the reader, matching what web ships: up to **4** pieces sharing
  the piece's **first tag**, with the current piece filtered out, rendered under the author card.
- Same data path — `GET /search/pieces?q=<tag name>&tag=<tag slug>&sort=trending`. **No backend
  change**; the AF4 recommender still needs `ai.use` and stays out of reach for this surface.
- Non-critical, exactly as on web: **no tags → no section**, and a failed load renders nothing
  rather than an error. It must never cost the reader the piece they came for.
- Reference: `frontend/src/features/reading/{hooks/use-related-pieces.ts,components/related-pieces.tsx}`
  and `api/reading.api.ts#related`. Mobile landed it in `lib/features/reading/` following that
  feature's existing repository → controller → widget layering.

**Two deliberate platform differences inside the port**, both forced by mobile's own structure and
recorded so neither reads as drift:

- **Position.** Web renders the section below its author card, which sits at the **end** of its page;
  mobile's author card sits **above** the prose, so the faithful equivalent is the end of the reader
  (after the comments/responses footer), not directly under the card.
- **Data path ownership.** Web's reading feature calls `/search/pieces` from its own `api/` layer;
  mobile does the same from its own `PieceRemoteDataSource`, because
  `qalam-mobile/docs/folder-structure.md` forbids a feature importing `features/search`. Same
  endpoint, same query (`q=<tag name>&tag=<tag slug>&sort=trending`), no backend change.

Closed out per this document's own rule: §3 row deleted, sweep re-dated, port reported in
`qalam-mobile/docs/55_MobileRelatedPiecesPort.md`.

## 4. Divergences that are NOT gaps (platform-inherent)

These are accepted permanently and need no epic. They exist because the platforms genuinely differ.

| Mobile-only                  | Why it is not a web gap                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `splash`, `shell`            | App launch + native navigation shell. The web equivalent is the router + app layout.                                          |
| `storage` screen             | Device cache management (clear cached pieces/images). A browser owns its own cache.                                           |
| `gallery` page               | Native media picker/gallery. The web uses the file input + the existing cover uploader.                                       |
| Offline **read** cache       | Mobile caches pieces for offline reading via Hive boxes. Web has a service worker + the offline route, deliberately narrower. |
| Screenshot protection (P7.2) | A mobile OS capability with no browser equivalent.                                                                            |
| Haptics                      | No web analog.                                                                                                                |

**Partly inherent (item 9 above):** offline _reading_ is inherent, but the **offline write queue**
(like/bookmark/follow taken offline, reconciled on reconnect) is a real product behaviour that web
simply lacks. It is not required for parity of _features_, but it is a parity gap in _behaviour_ —
flagged here so a future epic decides explicitly rather than by omission.

### 4.1 Accepted layout differences — same feature, different arrangement

Not gaps, and not platform-inherent either: both clients ship the feature, they just order it
differently. Filed here because [§6](#6-parity-check--run-at-the-end-of-every-client-epic) requires
every known difference to live in §2, §3, or §4 — so a later epic comparing the two surfaces sees
"known and accepted" rather than a bug to fix.

| Surface    | Difference                                                                                                                                                                         | Why it is accepted                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reader** | Web: author card at the **end** of the page, "More like this" below it. Mobile: author card **above** the prose, "More like this" at the end, after the comments/responses footer. | Mobile's author card placement predates the W-1 port and is the reader's byline-in-context; moving it would be a redesign of a shipped surface, not a parity fix. Both clients render the same two components with the same behaviour. |

**Status of the reader row: parked, not closed.** Raised with the product owner on 2026-07-28 and
deliberately deferred — judged low priority, and possibly worth aligning later. So it is accepted
_for now_, not accepted permanently: nothing is blocked on it, no epic owns it, and no client should
change its reader layout on the strength of this row alone.

If a future epic (or the owner) wants the two readers aligned, that is a **roadmap decision** (§5's
standard) — a row in [45](./45_WebClientRoadmap.md) naming which client moves — not something an epic
does in passing.

---

## 5. The unassigned gaps — a real hole in the plan

Items **3 (partly), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8** — plus **P-1 / P-2** in §5.1 — are not owned by any W-track row. The W-track was written to
close the AF1–AF6 client gap, and these fall outside those AF epics. (**W-1 is no longer in this
list** — it was closed by the 2026-07-28 port, §3.1.)

- **Conversation layer** — comments and responses have UI on mobile and none on web. `W3` is
  collaboration/trust and `W4` is monetization; **neither owns comments/responses**.
- **Collections** — mobile has a collections list + detail; web has neither, and no row covers it.
- **Clap / report** — deliberately scoped out of W1, with no row that picks them up.
- **Reader analytics, onboarding, privacy prefs, AI conversations + prompt library + usage** — all
  mobile-shipped, none in the W-track.

### 5.1 Both-platform product gaps in inline review (opened 2026-07-28, after W3b)

Not divergences — **neither client does these**, so they need a roadmap decision rather than a port.
Recorded here because W3b drew them as boundaries, and a boundary that lives only in a commit message
is how the debt in this document accumulated in the first place.

| P-1 | **Applying an accepted suggestion** | `POST /suggestions/:id/accept` records the decision and **does not touch the prose**. Web says so on the accepted card; **mobile toasts "Suggestion accepted." and changes nothing** — silently. | Editor integration: hand the anchored replacement to the editor, which applies it through its own commands (app-level seam, [49 §4](./49_WebCollaborationEpicDesign.md)). Alternatively a backend change so accept rewrites the piece — a product decision, not a client one. |
| P-2 | **Composing @mentions**             | `mentions` on the wire are resolved user **ids**. Neither composer sends any, so a typed `@handle` is plain text and nobody is notified.                                                         | Handle→id resolution per mention inside the composer — the same lookup the invite dialog uses, applied inline.                                                                                                                                                                |

**P-1 is correctness-shaped, not a nicety.** A writer who accepts a suggestion reasonably expects the
wording to change; on mobile they are told it was accepted and nothing happens. Whatever the roadmap
decides, mobile's toast should stop implying an edit occurred.

**This needs a roadmap decision, not more building.** The honest options are (a) add a `W7 —
engagement & parity backfill` row covering items 4, 5, 6, 8, plus a `W8` for the remaining
AI surfaces, or (b) explicitly accept them as mobile-only and record that here. Until one of those
happens they are **tracked, unowned gaps** — which is better than being invisible, and worse than
being planned.

## 6. Parity check — run at the end of every client epic

Added to the per-epic flow as step 7 ([45 §2](./45_WebClientRoadmap.md)):

1. **Did this epic deliver only what its roadmap row named?** Anything extra is a divergence — take
   it out, or record it in §3 with a resolution.
2. **Does the platform that already had this feature actually have every part I built?** Open the
   reference screens and compare, surface by surface. Do not trust a roadmap paraphrase (§3).
3. **Does the other platform now need a follow-up?** If yes, add a row to §3.
4. **Re-sweep §2** for the area touched, and update the "Last swept" date at the top.
5. **Nothing is left unrecorded.** A known difference that is in neither §2, §3 nor §4 is a bug in
   this document.
